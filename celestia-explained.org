#+title: Celestia Explained

* What is Celestia?
Celestia is a *modular data availability (DA) network* that securely scales with
the number of users, making it easy for anyone to launch their own blockchain.

And by making the blockchain stack modular, anyone can launch their own
blockchain without needing a validator set.
* What is data availability?
Usually, Users of a monolithic blockchain usually download all the data to check
that it is available.

As blocks get bigger, it becomes impractical for normal users to download all
the data meaning that they canâ€™t verify the chain. Modular chains solve this
problem by making it possible for users to verify very large blocks using a
technology called *data availability sampling*.
* What's data availability sampling?
Data availability sampling (DAS) is the new primitive that *enables Celestia
light nodes to verify DA efficiently*. Instead of downloading all data, *light
nodes only download a tiny portion of each block*.

Importantly, DAS allows Celestia to scale with the number of users (light
nodes). So, *as the light node network grows* *over time, Celestia can scale to
the data throughput needed* for millions of rollups without compromising on
security for end users.
* And what is a modular blockchain?
Modular blockchains are a new paradigm in blockchain design. Instead of one
blockchain doing everything, modular blockchains specialize and optimize to
perform a given function. This specialization provides breakthroughs in
scalability, flexibility, and interoperability, enabling developers to build
blockchain applications for mass adoption.

The modules of Celestia (and other modular blockchain) are:
1) Execution
2) Settlement
3) Consensus (Proof of Stake)
4) Data availability
